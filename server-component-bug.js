In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using server components with dynamic routes and data fetching.  If you fetch data within a server component using `async/await` and that data influences which UI component to render (e.g., conditionally rendering based on fetched data), you might encounter unexpected behavior.  The problem stems from the server component's lifecycle and how data is fetched. The component may render an initial state based on incomplete data, potentially resulting in incorrect component rendering even after the data has fully resolved.  This can be particularly problematic for dynamic routes because the initial render may take place before the data is ready.
